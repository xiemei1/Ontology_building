{"debates": " Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I am Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\u201d I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  How are you, Donald?\n(APPLAUSE)\n  Good luck to you.\n(APPLAUSE)\nWell, I do not expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we are going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\nwe are calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\u201d And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n  Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n  I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\nHow are we going to do it? we are going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it is good to be with you. we are going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n  Secretary Clinton, thank you.\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. it is about putting money \u2014 more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n  Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. they are going to Mexico. they are going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. they are devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they are using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\nSo we are losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it is the eighth wonder of the world. they are building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. they are all leaving. And we can not allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we are going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left \u2014 fired 1,400 people. they are going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n  We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. it is going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n  Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n  Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\nI do not buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n  Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n  Well, for one thing \u2014 and before we start on that \u2014 my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\nOur country's in deep trouble. We do not know what we are doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. they are the best, the best ever at it. What they are doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they are taking our jobs, they are giving incentives, they are doing things that, frankly, we do not do.\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. we are on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in \u2014 automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. it is a defective agreement. it is been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton \u2014 yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. it is very important to me.\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. she is been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact\u2026\n  Let me interrupt just a moment, but\u2026\n  Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is \u2014 look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.   Back to the question, though. How do you bring back \u2014 specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n  Well, the first thing you do is do not let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. they are leaving, and they are leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I am saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\n  Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\n  Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\u201d Well, it did collapse.\n  That's called business, by the way.\n  Nine million people \u2014 nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we are now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it is real.\n  I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n  I think science is real.\n  I do not say that.\n  And I think it is important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we are going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\n  Mr. Trump?\n  She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\nNow, look, I am a great believer in all forms of energy, but we are putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can not do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he is topped it. he is doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they are not doing it.\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they are gone.\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\n  Well, actually\u2026\n  I will bring \u2014 excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can not bring back jobs.\n  Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\n  Yeah, for 30 years.\n  And I have \u2014 well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again\u2026\n  Well, he approved NAFTA\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  \u2026 million new jobs, a balanced budget\u2026\n  He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\n  Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we are actually going to look at the facts.\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I am going to do. I am going to have a special prosecutor. we are going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we are going to hold people accountable.\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\n  Very quickly\u2026\n  But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to\u2026\n  Well, I've been a senator, Donald\u2026\n  You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\n  And I have been a secretary of state\u2026\n  Excuse me.\n  And I have done a lot\u2026\n  Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\n  Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\n  You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can not win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\n  Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in\u2026\n  You called it the gold standard.\n(CROSSTALK)\n  You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it is the finest deal you've ever seen.\n  No.\n  And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\n  Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are \u2014 I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated\u2026\n  Not.\n  \u2026 which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book\u2026\n  So is it President Obama's fault?\n  \u2026 before you even announced.\n  Is it President Obama's fault?\n  Look, there are differences\u2026\n  Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\n  There are\u2026\n  Because he is pushing it.\n  There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it is important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\n  But you have no plan.\n  But in \u2014 oh, but I do.\n  Secretary, you have no plan.\n  In fact, I have written a book about it. it is called \"Stronger Together.\u201d You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore\u2026\n  That's about all you've\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  Folks, we are going to\u2026\n  \u2026 or at an airport near you.\n  we are going to move to\u2026\n  But it is because I see this \u2014 we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\n  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I am very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\nWhen I go around \u2014 Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing \u2014 the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I am cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\nI am going to cut regulations. I am going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\n  Let me get you to pause right there, because we are going to move into \u2014 we are going to move into the next segment. we are going to talk taxes\u2026\n  That can not \u2014 that can not be left to stand.\n  Please just take 30 seconds and then we are going to go on.\n  I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so\u2026\n  Facts.\n  So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed\u2026\n  And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\n  \u2026 would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it is time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\n  Well, you just opened the next segment.\n  Well, could I just finish \u2014 I think I\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  I am going to give you a chance right here\u2026\n  I think I should \u2014 you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\n  \u2026 with a new 15-minute segment\u2026\n  she is going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\n  Mr. Trump, I am going to\u2026\n  And look at her website. You know what? it is no difference than this. she is telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I do not think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\n  The next segment, we are continuing\u2026\n  Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\n  \u2026 achieving prosperity\u2026\n  No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\n  No, we are not. No, we are not.\n  See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting \u2014 no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\n  That's a \u2014 that's \u2014 go to the \u2014 please, fact checkers, get to work.\n  OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we are still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\n  Well, I am really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. they are going to expand their companies. they are going to do a tremendous job.\nI am getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it is not a tax \u2014 it is really not a great thing for the wealthy. it is a great thing for the middle class. it is a great thing for companies to expand.\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they are going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can not bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what \u2014 is so bad.\nSo what they are doing is they are leaving our country, and they are, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can not work out a deal to \u2014 and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\nInstead of that, they are leaving our country to get their money, because they can not bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can not get together. Because we have \u2014 we have a president that can not sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it is double that. it is probably $5 trillion that we can not bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\n  All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\n  I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I am going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\n  Why not?\n  Why not? Yeah, why not?\n(LAUGHTER)\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case\u2026\n  There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\n  This is \u2014 this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\n  Yes.\n  Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I do not see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\n  Then you didn't read it.\n  I happen to \u2014 I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a\u2026\n  Who gave it that name? The first I've \u2014 who gave it that name?\n(CROSSTALK)\n  Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\n  \u2026 $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing\u2026\n  How much? How much for my family?   \u2026 it is\u2026\n  Lester, how much?\n  \u2026 as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\n  I do not think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their \u2014 their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\n  Mr. Trump, we are\u2026\n  Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: we are in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political \u2014 by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\n  Mr. Trump, we are talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to \u2014 who he owes it to and any business conflicts. do not Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\n  I do not mind releasing \u2014 I am under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And \u2014 as soon as the audit is finished, it will be released.\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income \u2014 in fact, the income \u2014 I just looked today \u2014 the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it is the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody \u2014 Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\n  The IRS says an audit\u2026\n  Excuse me.\n  \u2026 of your taxes \u2014 you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal\u2026\n  Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I am not even complaining. I do not mind it. it is almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people do not.\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns \u2014 against my lawyer's wishes \u2014 when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.\n(APPLAUSE)\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against \u2014 my lawyers, they say, \"do not do it.\u201d I will tell you this. No \u2014 in fact, watching shows, they are reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you do not release your returns until the audit is complete. When the audit is complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\n  So it is negotiable?\n  it is not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000\u2026\n  Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he is not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be.\n  Third, we do not know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he is paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\n  That makes me smart.\n  So if he is paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he is not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he is trying to hide.\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they do not give you the tax rate. They do not give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he is ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he is hiding.\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he is hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\n  He also \u2014 he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\n  I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.   That's for sure.\n  And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I am not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\n  Mr. Trump?\n  That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they are not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it is disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it is \u2014 really thinks it is disgraceful, also.\nAs far as my tax returns, you do not learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\nThe other thing, I am extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 \u2014 which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. it is not a lot of money relative to what I had.\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was \u2014 actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it is not $650. it is much less than that.\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would \u2014 if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. it is because it is about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it is one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible \u2014 you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land \u2014 we've become a third world country.\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we are a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it is 6 or 5, but it looks like it is 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\nAnd it is really a shame. And it is politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. we are a debtor nation. we are a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we do not have the money, because it is been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n  We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\n  And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)\nAnd the other thing I think is important\u2026\n  It would be squandered, too, believe me.\n  \u2026 is if your \u2014 if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. it is a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do\u2026\n  Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work\u2026\n  Well, to\u2026\n  Which our country should do, too.\n  Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\nI can only say that I am certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\n  Wrong. Wrong.\n  Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\n  Let's let Mr. Trump\u2026\n  And we need to be very clear about that.\n  So, yeah, I think \u2014 I do think it is time. Look, it is all words, it is all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. it is an unbelievable company.\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I am running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. we are just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I do not get there one way, I am going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\nBut we are opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I am a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they are supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we do not have people that know what they are doing.\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\n  Well, we are well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it is been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\n  Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they are treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they are well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\n  Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we are seeing today.\n  All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\n  Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we do not have it, we are not going to have a country.\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it is \u2014 I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long \u2014 we need law and order in our country.\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just \u2014 just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very \u2014 I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it is so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I am saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over \u2014 almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they are illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\nWe have to be \u2014 we have to know what we are doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\n  Your two \u2014 your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\n  No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it is allowed.\n  The argument is that it is a form of racial profiling.\n  No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be \u2014 when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You do not have good community relations in Chicago. it is terrible. I have property there. it is terrible what's going on in Chicago.\nBut when you look \u2014 and Chicago's not the only \u2014 you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\n  You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it is not good.\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\n  Secretary Clinton\u2026\n  But we need \u2014 Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it is very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, I've heard \u2014 I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it is really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\n  Ugh.\n  You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just do not want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it is just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say \u2014 we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I am glad that we are ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now \u2014 and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby \u2014 right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\n  Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\n  Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it is an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\n  They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\n  Mr. Trump\u2026\n  I'd like to respond to that.\n  Please.\n  First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I am very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they are protecting the Second Amendment.\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a \u2014 it is \u2014 it is been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I am talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I do not think \u2014 I really do not think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can not say it, but I really do not believe \u2014 in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. it is hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n  Well, it is also fair to say, if we are going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is\u2026\n  No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\n  No, I am not.\n  Murders are up. All right. You check it.\n  New York \u2014 New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit \u2014 I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\n  This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five\u2026\n  I'd like to just respond, if I might.\n  Please \u2014 20 seconds.\n  I'd just like to respond.\n  Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\n  I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\nThe African-American community \u2014 because \u2014 look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\n  Mr. Trump, let me\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  Well, I \u2014 I do think\u2026\n  And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities \u2014 and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just \u2014 you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\n  Mr. Trump, I\u2026\n  I think \u2014 I think \u2014 I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\n  I'll tell you very \u2014 well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close \u2014 very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to \u2014 during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\n  And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I am satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I am satisfied with it.\n  That was\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\n  I will let you respond. it is important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15\u2026\n  Yeah.\n  \u2026. as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\n  Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know \u2014 now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it is true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter \u2014 you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can not bring back jobs, she can not produce.\n  I am sorry. I am just going to follow up \u2014 and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we are talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  Well, it was very \u2014 I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, just listen to what you heard.\n(LAUGHTER)\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\nBut it can not be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\n  Mr. Trump, you can respond and we are going to move on to the next segment.\n  I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to \u2014 you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I do not think you can deny that.\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country \u2014 it was a federal lawsuit \u2014 were sued. We settled the suit with zero \u2014 with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\n  I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I do not do on you. Maybe I am trying to save the money.\nBut, frankly, I look \u2014 I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it is just one of those things.\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it is a tremendously successful club. And I am so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I am very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\n  Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\u201d We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\n  Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we are facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really\u2026\n(CROSSTALK)\n  \u2026 tough, long game here. And one of the things he is done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear \u2014 whether it is Russia, China, Iran or anybody else \u2014 the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\nAnd we are going to have to make it clear that we do not want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We do not want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so \u2014 I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. it is one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information \u2014 in administrations\u2026\n  Your two minutes have expired.\n  \u2026 have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. it is comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\n  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n  I do want to say that I was just endorsed \u2014 and more are coming next week \u2014 it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here \u2014 admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I am very proud of it.\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed \u2014 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we are in. Look at the mess that we are in.\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we are not. I do not think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. she is saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I do not \u2014 maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\n  You do not know who broke in to DNC.\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we do not know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they are beating us at our own game. ISIS.\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is \u2014 it is a huge problem. I have a son. he is 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it is unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it is hardly doable.\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\nwe are making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we are hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\n  You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\n  Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\u201d Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out \u2014 what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\nSo she talks about taking them out. she is been doing it a long time. she is been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil \u2014 and we should have taken the oil \u2014 ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil \u2014 a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\n  Wrong.\n  That is absolutely proved over and over again.\n  Wrong. Wrong.\n  He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\n  But the larger point \u2014 and he says this constantly \u2014 is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\nwe are working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. we are working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\nthey are on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\n  Mr. Trump\u2026\n  Well, I have to respond.\n  Please respond.   The secretary said very strongly about working with \u2014 we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it is a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they are going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they are going.\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I am a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two \u2014 and that bothers me, because we should be asking \u2014 we are defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they are supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because \u2014 and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest \u2014 but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get \u2014 because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. it is a lot of money to protect other people. But I am all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\nAnd they are going to do that. And that was \u2014 believe me \u2014 I am sure I am not going to get credit for it \u2014 but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can not believe it. They said\u2026\n  Lester, we've covered\u2026\n  No, wait a minute.\n  We've covered this ground.\n  When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it is in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I do not think so.\n  Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your\u2026\n  I did not support the war in Iraq.\n  In 2002\u2026\n  That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she \u2014 frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n  My question is, since you supported it\u2026\n  Just \u2014 would you like to hear\u2026\n  \u2026 why is your \u2014 why is your judgment\u2026\n  Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\n  The record shows otherwise, but why \u2014 why was\u2026\n  The record does not show that.\n  Why was \u2014 is your judgment any\u2026\n  The record shows that I am right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I do not know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said \u2014 and he called me the other day \u2014 and I spoke to him about it \u2014 he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\n  Why is your judgment better than\u2026\n  And when he \u2014 excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people \u2014 he is willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely \u2014 because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody \u2014 and I'll ask the press \u2014 if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it is a terrible and a stupid thing. it is going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it is done. it is been a disaster.\n  My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was\u2026\n  No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\n  Why is your judgment \u2014 why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\n  Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?\n(LAUGHTER)\nI have a much better \u2014 she spent \u2014 let me tell you \u2014 she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising \u2014 you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names \u2014 oh, temperament, let's go after \u2014 I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a\u2026\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I do not know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\n  Secretary Clinton?\n  Whew, OK.\n(LAUGHTER)\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it is ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\n  That would not start a war.\n  That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part\u2026\n  No, they were taunting us.\n  \u2026 of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine\u2026\n  Wrong.\n  \u2026 have a good time, folks.\n  it is lies.\n  And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\n  That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to\u2026\n  it is a good one, though. It well describes the problem.\n(LAUGHTER)\n  it is not an accurate one at all. it is not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things \u2014 and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your \u2014 your president thinks.\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we are losing a fortune. That's why we are losing \u2014 we are losing \u2014 we lose on everything. I say, who makes these \u2014 we lose on everything. All I said, that it is very possible that if they do not pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we are doing. We can not defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million\u2026\n  We need to move on.\n  Well, wait, but it is very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. we are a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\n  Our last\u2026\n  As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\n  Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\n  Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she is very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their \u2014 they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they are old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not \u2014 we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it is over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can not take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we are doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they do not have to do much.\n  Your two minutes is expired.\n  And they are going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he is not a happy camper.\n  All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n  Well, let me \u2014 let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to \u2014 on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\nit is also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he is going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it is like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it is a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they are abroad or at home.\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security\u2026\n  Your two minutes is\u2026\n  \u2026 to be given any opportunities at all.\n  \u2026 is expired.\n  Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\n  Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\n  I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it is getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they are in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\n  Mr. Trump\u2026\n  And it is a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world\u2026\n  We have just\u2026\n  \u2026 where they are not paying us what we need.\n  We have just a few final questions\u2026\n  And she doesn't say that, because she is got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she is talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\n  Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\u201d she is standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\n  She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I do not believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n  The quote was, \"I just do not think she has the presidential look.\u201d\n  You have \u2014 wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we are defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we are defending them, and they are not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I do not believe that Hillary has the stamina.\n  Let's let her respond.   Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  The world \u2014 let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it is bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last \u2014 so she is got experience, that I agree.\n(APPLAUSE)\nBut it is bad, bad experience. Whether it is the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it is the Iran deal, whether it is anything you can \u2014 name \u2014 you almost can not name a good deal. I agree. she is got experience, but it is bad experience. And this country can not afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\n  We are at \u2014 we are at the final question.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\n  Very quickly, because we are at the final question now.\n  You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said\u2026\n  I never said that.\n  \u2026. women do not deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\n  I didn't say that.\n  And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\u201d Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\u201d because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\n  Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\n  Her name is Alicia Machado.\n  Where did you find this?\n  And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet\u2026\n  Oh, really?   \u2026 she is going to vote this November.\n  OK, good. Let me just tell you\u2026\n(APPLAUSE)\n  Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question\u2026\n  You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it is said in entertainment. Some of it is said \u2014 somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something\u2026\n  Please very quickly.\n  \u2026 extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can not do it. I just can not do it. it is inappropriate. it is not nice.\u201d But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. they are untrue. And they are misrepresentations.\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: it is not nice. And I do not deserve that.\nBut it is certainly not a nice thing that she is done. it is hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money\u2026\n  We have to move on to the final question.\n  \u2026 $200 million is spent, and I am either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\n  Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. it is not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\n  Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?   I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. we are losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they do not even know.\n  Will you accept the outcome of the election?\n  Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I am going to be able to do it. I do not believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\n(APPLAUSE)\n  All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.\nA reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone.\n \n\t\t\t Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton. Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice? Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on. Yes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So, Mr. Trump... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Have you ever done those things? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places. We\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And that\u2019s what I want to talk about. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is. But I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And we want to get to some questions from online... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Yes, you can respond to that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Sounds fair. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high. And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that. (CROSSTALK) I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Oh, really? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In the first debate... (LAUGHTER) \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And really, the audience needs to calm down here. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people. So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because you\u2019d be in jail. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton... We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time. And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that. But I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t OK, we\u2019re going to move on. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant. You know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so. She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have to move on. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You did that. Wait a minute. One second. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on. We want to give the audience a chance. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Allow her to respond, please. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It was personal e-mails, not official. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Oh, 33,000? Yeah. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because you have nothing to say. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Get off this question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let\u2019s see what happens... (CROSSTALK) \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Allow her to respond. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We brought up the e-mails. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Ken Karpowicz has a question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better? That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead. (LAUGHTER) \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, your time is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care. It\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, your time... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your time is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t By the way... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What does that mean? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates. Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over? Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists. And she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see. It\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me.. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe... TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time. I do. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That\u2019s not been debunked. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So, please... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That has not been debunked. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She did not. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Could I just respond to this, please? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Very quickly, please. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... with the Russians and other foreign powers. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t... (LAUGHTER) OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Mr. Trump. We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer? Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do. But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Secretary. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us. Hey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In the past... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Allow her to respond. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because I was a senator with a Republican president. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Oh, really? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, secretary. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, secretary. We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And one thing I have to say. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your two minutes is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president... (LAUGHTER) ... what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You disagree with your running mate? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly. I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What do you think will happen if it falls? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks. Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country? RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare. I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It might be to help get civilians out. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Tell me what your strategy is. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul. Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy. I do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Everything. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t. There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation. I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help. I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You had many answers. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter? My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States? That question begins for Mr. Trump. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back. Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things. I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen. Let me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, thank you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It turned out to be a disaster. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that. Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your time, Secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your two minutes is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I want to be the best president I can be for every American. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans. And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Secretary. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I want to give you a minute to respond. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She said some of them are irredeemable. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You mentioned sex tape. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t ... 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I\u2019m shocked to hear that. (LAUGHTER) \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent. And it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me. And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have to move along. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Nine million people lost their jobs. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, we have to... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Five million homes were lost. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have the slowest growth since 1929. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We\u2019re moving to an audience question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you. (LAUGHTER) We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates. Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice? We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this. So I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. I ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? It\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well... (CROSSTALK) \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have to save as many lives as we possibly can. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken? What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers? Mr. Trump, two minutes? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your time is up. Thank you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition. We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton... \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your time is up. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Time is up. We have time for one more... We have... One more audience question. We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker. Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another? Mr. Trump, would you like to go first? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. I will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thanks to both of you. We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched. Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format. Six roughly 15-minute segments, with two minute answers to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with a commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let's get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court. You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century. First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what\u2019s your view on how the constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly, according to changing circumstances? In this segment, secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you very much Chris and thanks to UNLV for hosting us. You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election. Namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people. Not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say, the Supreme Court should represent all of us. That's how I see the court. And the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That's the way the constitution fundamentally should operate. The President nominates and the Senate advises and consents or not. But they go forward with the process. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country and how do you believe the constitution should be interpreted? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, it\u2019s so great to be with you and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court, it is what it is all about. Our country is so, so, it is just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people. Many, many millions of people that I represent and she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment and all amendments, but the second amendment which is under absolute siege. I believe, if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a second amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it is absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma. I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint, and I've named 20 of them. The justices that I am going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the second amendment. They are great scholars in all cases and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted and I believe that\u2019s very important. I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It is all about the constitution of, and it is so important. The constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, thank you. We now have about ten minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that in fact, by the justices that you name, could end up changing the existing law of the land. First, is one that you mentioned Mr. Trump, and that is guns. Secretary Clinton, you said last year, and let me quote: \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the second amendment.\u201d And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the judge Antonin Scalia, who wrote the decision. What's wrong with that? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, I support the second amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership that goes back to the founding of our country, but I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the second amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible, that are the kinds of reforms that would make a difference, that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision and what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case. Because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns. And so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court did not accept that reasonable regulation but they've accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the second amendment. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan debate coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here. And this was in fact one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the second amendment is protected? You just heard secretary Clinton's answer. Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation, that in fact she in fact she supports the second amendment right to bear arms. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well the D.C. versus Heller decision was very strongly... and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved and it was a well crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset. Extremely angry. And people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let me bring in secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I was upset because unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns because unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions. But there is no doubt that I respect the second amendment. That I also believe there is an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, common sense regulation. And you know, look. I understand that Donald has been strongly supported by the NRA, the gun lobby is on his side. They're running millions of dollars of ads against me and I regret that because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say, of course we're going to protect and defend the second amendment. But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this because in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high capacity magazines. You support a national right-to-carry law. Why, sir? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, let me just tell you before we go any further, in Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the second amendment. And I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA and it was the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justices, this is the best way to help the second amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment. That will not do damage to the second amendment. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you, and the justices that, whoever ends up winning this election appoints, could have a dramatic effect there. That's the issue of abortion. Mr. Trump, you're pro-life. And I want to ask you specifically. Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes, in fact, states a woman's right to abortion. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that would go back to the individual states. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I'm asking you specifically would you- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If they overturned it, it would go back to the states. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But what I'm asking you, do you want to see the court overturn it? You just said you want to see the court protect the second amendment, do you want to see the court overturn- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen. That will happen automatically in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this. It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it is not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what is happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding planned parenthood which, of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said he is in favor of defunding planned parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund planned parenthood. I will defend planned parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade and I will defend women's rights to make their own healthcare decisions. We have come too far to have that turn back now. And indeed, he said women should be punished. There should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I'm going to give you a chance to respond. But I wanted to ask you secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you think the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late term partial birth abortions. Why? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who have, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get. That their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term. Or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, your reaction. Particularly on this issue of late term partial birth abortions. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well I think it is terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that is okay and Hillary can say that that is okay, but it's not okay with me. Because based on what she is saying and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb. In the ninth month. On the final day. And that's not acceptable. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women I've met with. Women I've known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said. Doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t All right. Let's move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually there are many issues that separate the two of you. Mr. Trump. You want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president, you\u2019re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong? Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment, you have two minutes.\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster. And very unfair to all of the people waiting in line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience we have four mothers of - I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed, by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. As you know, the border patrol agents, 16,500 plus I.C.E. last week endorsed me. First time they've endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\u2019s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have, it\u2019s with all the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. All of the problems. The single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders. Just pouring and destroying their youth It is poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. Right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute, we cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. The border patrol, I.C.E., they all want the wall. We stop the drugs\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard. They do everything they can to give her a good life. And you're right. I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending families away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children. 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix, that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Here's with a that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business. Rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then to have put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it is an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan, of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed. Getting rid of any violent person, anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building. He went to Mexico. Had a meeting with the Mexican president. He didn't even raise it. He choked. And then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you secretary Clinton. I want to follow-up- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Chris, I think it\u2019s -- I think I should respond. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the President of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody. It\u2019s a disaster. Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or there abouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, let me -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We are a country of laws. By the way -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I would like to hear from secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I voted for border security and- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And a wall. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that. But it is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing. He started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different there view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy would be good. Because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do. You complain, I'll get you deported. I want to get everybody out of the shadows. Get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts American workers. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what has happened and that\u2019s what happened - big league. As far as moving these people out and moving, we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't. Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it\u2019s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process bigly, because it\u2019s very inefficient. But they're on line and they\u2019re waiting to become citizens. Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen. Under her plan you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade and and you will have a disaster with your open borders. What she doesn\u2019t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We will not have open borders. That is a rank mischaracterization. We will have secure borders. But we will also have reform. This used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president to sign -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t To sign immigration reform and George W. Bush supported it as well. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from Wikileaks, that you said this. And I want to quote. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That's the question. Please, quiet, everybody. Is that your dream? Open borders? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. We trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us. But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. What is really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government. Clearly from Putin himself in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this, and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election. That he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past. Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders. Okay? How did we get on to Putin? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Hold on, folks. Because this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet. For the candidates and for the American people. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Just to finish on the borders, she wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550% more people than Barack Obama. And he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you. She wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what. We're in very serious trouble. Because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads, 1,800, by the way. Where they expanded and we didn't. 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she is playing chicken. Look. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wait. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Putin from everything I see has no respect for this person. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, that's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No puppet. You're the puppet. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is pretty clear you won't admit that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America. That you encouraged espionage against our people. That you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do. And that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race. So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17, 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin. And they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And I think it is time -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She has no idea whether it is Russia, China or anybody else. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I am not quoting myself. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You have no idea. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I am quoting 17, 17 -- do you doubt? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Our country has no idea. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Our military and civilian - \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Yeah, I doubt it, I doubt it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t He would rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria, he\u2019s outsmarted her every step of the way. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I do get to ask some questions. And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t By Russia or anybody else. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Do you condemn their interference? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Of course I condemn, of course I condemn - I don't know Putin. I have no idea- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I'm not asking you that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, it wouldn't be so bad. Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it is Syria. You name it. Missiles. Take a look at the start-up that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin and all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They\u2019ve taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We're a long way away from immigration. I'm going to let you finish this. You have about 45 seconds. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And she always will be. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I find it ironic that he is raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t He has advocated more countries getting them. Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s said if we have them, why don't we use them which I think is terrifying. But here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There is about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that is why ten people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I have 200 generals and admirals, 21 endorsing me. 21 congressional medal of honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world. We're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century. All I said is we have to renegotiate these agreements. Because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford. She took that as saying nuclear weapons. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Okay. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Look. She's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I'm just quoting you when- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t There is no quote. You won't find a quote from me. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Nuclear competition in Asia. You said go ahead. Enjoy yourselves, folks. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And defend yourselves. And defend yourselves. I didn't say -- and defend yourself. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East and elsewhere. That is the only way -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We are going to move on to the next topic which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation. We\u2019re going to drill down into this a little bit more. In this overview, please explain to me why you believe your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not. In this round, you go first, secretary Clinton. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well I think the middle class thrives, America thrives. So my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high wage countries and I believe we should. New jobs in clean energy. Not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business, that\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want to us raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education and community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young peel for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or a university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is. Because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the great recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes. To give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations. Adding $20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before. Because it truly will be trickle down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another great recession. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary, thank you Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition but the rest the public is going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan. But I would like to start off where we left. Because when I said Japan and Germany and I'm not just singling them out. But South Korea, these are very rich countries. Saudi Arabia. Nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying? She immediately, when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO, why aren\u2019t they NATO questioned? Why aren't they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying. Since I did this, this was a year ago. All of a sudden they're paying. And I've been given a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people. They have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO but they have to pay up. She comes out and says \u201cwe love our allies. We think our allies are great.\u201d Well, it is awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea. We have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion. So my plan, we\u2019re going to negotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. More free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed. NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever. The jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at the places I just left. You go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go to upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back. I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal, then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We're going to have trade but we're going to terminate it. We're going on make a great trade deal. If we can't, we're going to go our separate way because it has been a disaster. We're going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people we're going to bring the $2.5 trillion that\u2019s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again because right now, our country is dying. At 1% GDP. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let me translate that if I can, Chris. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t You can't. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The fact is, he is going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen. Three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. He mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds. So yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments. Investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That's the kind of approach-- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- that will work. Cutting taxes on the wealthy. We've tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan because in many ways, it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Correct. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, sir. You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with the stimulus. So is your plan basically more, even more of the Obama stimulus? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, it is a combination, Chris. Let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch and go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession. So now we've dug ourselves out of it. We're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out, and the ground up. Not the top down. That is not going to work. That is why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt. But it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes. And we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We have got to do more to get the whole economy moving and that's what I believe I will be able to do. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up. That your idea, and you\u2019ve talked about 25 million jobs created. 4% growth- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Over a 10-year period. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- is unrealistic. And they say, you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic as well. Your response? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8%. China is growing at 7%. And that for them is a catastrophically low number. We are growing our last report came out, and it is right around the 1% level. And I think it\u2019s going down. Last week as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact, I said is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily because it was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs, we've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many, I\u2019ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what has happened. I pass factories that were thriving, 20, 25 years ago and because of the bill her husband signed and that she blessed 100%. It is just horrible what has happened to these people in these communities. Now, she can say her husband did well but boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in because it didn't really kick in very much. But it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that has ever been signed by our country. Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked and they said I was right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I want to give you a chance to briefly speak to that then I want to pivot -- to Obamacare. But go ahead. Briefly. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And that will be as bad as NAFTA. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn't meet my test. I've had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes and further our national security. I\u2019m against it now. I\u2019ll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president. There's only one of us on this stage who has actually shipped jobs to Mexico because that's Donald. He has shipped jobs to 12 countries including Mexico. But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I have stood up against it as Secretary of State. Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is. But he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers. That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work. We're going to pull the country together. We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we're going to enforce those agreements and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Can I ask a simple question? She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years? You were very much involved. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I voted -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience. But it is bad experience because what you've done has turned out badly. For 30 years you've been in a position to help. And if you say that I used steel or I used something else, I- make it impossible for me to do. I wouldn't mind. The problem is, you talk but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State department. $6 billion was either stolen, they don't know. It\u2019s gone. $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it\u2019s been debunked numerous times. but I think it's really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the children's defense fund and I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings. In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, and called her an eating machine. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Give me a break. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And on the day when I was in the situation room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin laden to justice, he was hosting The Celebrity Apprentice. So I\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I\u2019ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families, get ahead and stay ahead, with your thirty years and I'll let the American people make that decision. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan, but I built a phenomenal company. And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that would you would be so proud of, you would even be proud of it. And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria, take a look at the migration, take a look at Libya, take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because, we should have never been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. Now I listen to how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get to rid of nobody. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We're going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent. Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this. Why would they make up these stories? And since this is a question for both of you, secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and what you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people, I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence. She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people. They paid them $1500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things. I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false. I have to say that, and I didn't even apologize to my wife who is sitting right here because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these women. I didn't see these women. These women, the woman on the plane, the woman on the - I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence -- and I'll tell you what. In particular, in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have killed in that riot. And that's now all on tape started by her. I believe, Chris, she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their ten minutes of fame, but they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies and it was fiction. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women, and after that a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for \u2013 \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I did not say that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- them to be assaulted. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I did not say that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In fact, he went on to say -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Her two minutes. Sire, her two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I did not say that. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Her two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t He went on to say \u201clook at her, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d About another woman, he said \u201cthat wouldn't be my first choice.\u201d He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her disgusting, as he has called a number of women during this campaign. Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere that doesn't know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is. I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. America is great because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Please, everybody. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different. She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. What happened to the FBI, I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI, one lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general, and she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, every time Donald is pushed on something, which is obviously uncomfortable like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility and it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything, so we know what he has said and what he's done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t He went after Mr. And Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a gold star family because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers people that aren't captured. He went after a federal judge born in Indiana but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican. So it's not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is, and I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence. It's on tape. The other things are false, but honestly I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS and I'd love to talk about other things. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Okay. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But those other charges, as she knows, are false. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t In this bucket about fitness to be president there's been a lot of developments over the last ten days since the last debate. I'd like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have. Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got speciall access to you, those seeking grants for Haiti relief separately from non-donors and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money. Can you really say you've kept your pledge to that Senate committee and why isn\u2019t what happened and what went on and between you and the Clinton Foundation? Why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay-to-play? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The state department has said that. I think that's been proven, but I am happy -- in fact, I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity and I'm so proud of the work that it does. I could talk for the rest of the debate. I know I don't have the time to do that, but just briefly the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV AIDS to afford treatment and that's about half of all the people in the world that are getting treatment in partnership with the American health association. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is an open discussion. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, it is an open discussion. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The specific question is about pay to play -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t There is a lot of evidence about the very good work -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And it's a criminal enterprise -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Please let Mr. Trump speak. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia given $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business, off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don\u2019t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was in Little Haiti the other day in Florida, and I want to tell you they hate the Clintons because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it and they know it and everybody knows it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90%, 90%, of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs for people around the world and in our own country. I\u2019m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I would be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? I mean, it just was astonishing. But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had. We've done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti because it is an important part of the American experience. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I don't want you to help them anymore. I'd like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute. I contribute. The money goes, 100%, 100% goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don\u2019t get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuit, sir? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, we put up the American flag and that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t There was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach county -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t There was, there was and by the way, the money went to fisher house where they build houses, the money that you're talking about went to fisher house where they build houses for veterans and disabled veterans. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasn't released his tax returns. He's the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns. So everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We\u2019ve got them all out there. What is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. Half of all undocumented immigrants actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We're entitled because of the laws that people like her pass to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges and we do it. And all of her donors, just about all of them. I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars. Soros, George Soros took hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t --Let me just explain. All of her donors. Most of her donors -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Have done the same thing as I did. And you know what she should have done? You know Hillary, what you should have done? You should have changed the law when you were a United States senator if you don't like it -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thanks, we\u2019ve heard this. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- because your donors and special interests are doing the same thing as I do except even more so. You should have changed the law, but you won't change the law because you take in so much money. I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Made with Chinese steel. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I will tell you I sat there. I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, all false ads, all paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And frankly, you should have changed the laws. If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You've been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you. Your running mate Governor Pence pledged on Sunday that he and you, his words, will absolutely accept the result of this election. Today your daughter Ivanka said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you'll absolutely accept the result of the election. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now, I'll look at it at the time. What I've seen, what I\u2019ve seen, is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile on is so amazing. \"The New York Times\" actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It is so dishonest, and they have poisoned the minds of the voters. But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they\u2019re going to see through it, we\u2019ll find out on November 8th, but I think they\u2019re going to see through it. If you look -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But, but -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Excuse me, Chris. If you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote. Millions. This isn't coming from me. This is coming from Pew report and other places. Millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote. So let me just give you one other thing. I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people. I'll tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It\u2019s -- She's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run, and just in that respect I say it's rigged because she should never -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But, but -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Chris. She should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But, sir, there is a tradition in this country, in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and no matter how hard fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign, that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, okay? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well Chris, let me respond to that because that\u2019s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things aren't going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him. The FBI conducted a yearlong investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case. He said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus, he lost the Wisconsin primary, he said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then, Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Should have gotten it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This is a mind-set. This is how Donald thinks, and it's funny, but it's also really troubling. That is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished-- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Hold on, folks. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t-- It just shows you're not up to doing the job. And let's be clear about what he's saying and what that means. He's denigrating, he is talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the Attorney General, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t All right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think we've never had a situation so bad \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Hold on, folks. This doesn't do any good for anyone. Let's please continue the debate and let\u2019s move onto the subject of foreign hotspots. The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after and that's something whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront. Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, I am encouraged there is an effort led by the Iraqi Army, supported by Kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground, but I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It's going to be a hard fight. I've got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a really successful military operation. But we know we've got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians continue, so I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun. And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, okay? We announce we're going after Mosul. I've been reading about going after Mosul now for about how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves at the stupidity of our country. So we\u2019re now fighting for Mosul. That we had. All she had to do was stay there, now we\u2019re going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it -- and the only reason they did it is because she's running for office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes. He made all mistakes. That's why we have the great Migration, but she wanted to look good for the election. So they\u2019re going in. But who is going to get Mosul really? We'll take Mosul eventually. By the way, if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous, going to be more deaths than they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say what do we need this for. So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing, and Iran should write us a letter of thank you. Just like the really stupid, the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq. Something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them. So we're now going to take Mosul and you know who is going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Boy are they making, they are outsmarting\u2026 Look you're not there. You might be involved in that decision, but you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way -- the point is the big winner is going to be Iran. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, you know, once again Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- is a very clear fact that before the invasion \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t -- he supported it. I just want everybody to go google it. \u201cGoogle Donald Trump Iraq\u201d and you'll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wrong. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And you can hear the audio of him saying that. Why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better to contrast with me because I did vote for it. But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria, and yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, just like we went after Bin Laden while you were doing \"Celebrity apprentice\" and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership, but we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are several thousand fighters in Mosul. They\u2019ve been digging underground. They\u2019ve been prepared to defend. It's going to be tough fighting, but I think we can take back Mosul and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. This is what we have to do. I'm just am amazed that he seems to think the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that\u2019s how Donald thinks, you know, he always is looking for some conspiracy-- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We don't gain anything. Iran is taking over -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Iran is taking over Iraq. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t --his conspiracy theories- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We would have gained -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t For quite sometime -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion. Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak. Go ahead. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t He\u2019s unfit. He proves it every time. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t No, you're the one that's unfit. You know, Wikileaks just actually came out. John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and boy was he right. He said some beauties. And you know Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do. And if you think going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in and all of the people we really wanted, the leaders are all gone, if you think that was good, then you do. Now John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well you should ask Bernie Sanders who he is supporting for President. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Which is a big mistake \n\t\t \n\t\t\t And he said you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Let's turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo, and I want to follow up on that because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there are -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It's a catastrophe. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is a catastrophe. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It\u2019s a mess. Have you seen it? Have you seen it? Have you seen what\u2019s happened to Aleppo? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Sir, if I may finish my question. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Okay, so it hasn\u2019t fallen.Take a look at it. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well there are quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That\u2019s right. And they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t If I may just finish here. And you also said that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who have been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect admitting they have been bombing and shelling in Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well Aleppo is a disaster. It\u2019s a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen from any standpoint. What do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened. And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton. Because what's happened is by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought -- now she's going to say oh he loves Assad. He's much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We gave them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash, bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion. Now they have lined -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things because we're backing, we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are, and when and if -- and it's not going to happen because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with as bad as Assad is. And he\u2019s a bad guy. But you may very well end up with worse than Assad. If she did nothing, we would be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the Great Migration where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely in many cases, ISIS-aligned. And we now have them in our country. Wait til you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. Wait til you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, you have talked about in the last debate and again today that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it\u2019s gonna draw us closer and deeper into the conflict. And General Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you want to impose a no-fly zone, chances are you are going to get into a war, his words, with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is first, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day.This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground. We've had millions of people leave Syria, and those millions of people inside Syria who\u2019ve been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees, made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in, but I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting, and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse Night Club, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. Yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting. And I will defeat ISIS. And some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Folks, I want to get into our final segment. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t But I just have too... It\u2019s so ridiculous what she\u2026 she will defeat ISIS. We should never have let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now they are in 32 countries -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A ceasefire: United States, Russia, Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swathes of land and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on ceasefires. They are outplayed. She wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it, but our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad and, by the way, and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, no. We need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. Our national debt as a share of the economy, our GDP is now 77%. That's the highest since just after World War II, but the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86% of GDP for the next ten years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105% of GDP over the next ten years. The question is why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well I saw they're wrong because I\u2019m going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from really 1%, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it would be less than zero, but we\u2019re bringing it from 1% up to 4%, and I actually think we can go higher than 4%. I think you can go to 5% or 6%. And if we do, you don\u2019t have to bother asking your question. Because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs. We don't make our product anymore. It's very sad, but I am going to create a\u2026 the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy. We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world. Bigger than companies. You take these big companies. These trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom backed Hillary, I must say, but we don't use those people. Those are the people...these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution, and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are, so we have to use our great people. But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades and people, Chris, will again go back to work, and they'll make a lot of money, and we'll have companies that will will grow and expand and start from new. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \"Make America Great Again.\" I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, you know, before you and President Obama were there, I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out an $100,000 ad in the New York Times during the time when President Reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said right now. That we were the laughing stock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, you know, \u2018I alone can fix it,\u2019 as he said on the convention stage. But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear, we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We'll have what economists call middle outgrowth. We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class. The families of America. That's where growth will come from. That's why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family. And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know he started off with his dad as a millionaire. I started off with my dad as a small businessman. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We've heard this before, Hillary. We've heard this before. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I think it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Time. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, no. Because we're running out of time. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Because I disagreed with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right. And frankly now we're going to do it right. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t The one last area I want to get into with you in the debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60% of all federal spending. Now the committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare is going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits. In fact, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump. Would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect a grand bargain on entitlements? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow in a record rate. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t That's not going to help with entitlements. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t It is going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do is repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year [2017]. It is a disaster if we don't repeal and replace. It is probably going to die of its own weight, but Obamacare has to go. The premiums are going up 60%, 70%, 80%. Next year, they're going to go up over 100%. And I\u2019m really glad that the premiums have started, at least the people see what's happening because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, same question because at this point Social Security and Medicare are going to run out -- the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you, as president, consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well, Chris, I am record as saying we need to put more money into Social Security Trust fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up as will Donald's assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it, but what we want to do is -- \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Such a nasty woman. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Replenish the trust fund by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare. And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund. If he repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Your husband disagrees with you. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t We\u2019ve got to go after the long-term health care drivers. We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that, and I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control but with more resources and smart decisions. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t This is a final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on the stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven\u2019t prepared closing statements. So I would for each of you to take -- and we're going to put a clock up -- a minute as the final question, in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini segment. Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Well I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitment, your energy, your ambition. You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close, and I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work. That's what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way. But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called Make America Great Again. We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped. It has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into our country illegally better than we take care of our vets. That can\u2019t happen. Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos that she can do for ten lifetimes. All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote and then they come back, they say \u2018we\u2019ll see you in four years.\u2019 We are going to make America strong again and we are going to make America great again and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Thank you both. Secretary Clinton -- [ applause ] Hold on just a moment, folks. I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates. That brings us to the end of the three debates sponsored by the Commission of Presidential Debates. We want to thank the university of Nevada Las Vegas and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you. While millions have already voted, election day, November 8, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on is we hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you and good night.

Random Trump/debate thought: if things are so bad here in the US and all the big companies are moving/have moved to Mexico, why do we need to build a wall? Someone should make some real patriotic looking t-shirts that have different Trump quotes.\n\n\"We lose at everything\"\n\n\"We are basically a 3rd world country\"\n\n\"I've got all the best words\"\n\n\"Very against police judges\"\n\nAny other good ones I'm missing? I'm fairly moderate, although I lean Clinton because I love science + fact based arguments. It's important to note that the following is more about perception than what all the facts are.\n\nI actually believe Trump won the debate by winning the most important part: the economy. The economy is considered weak for a large number of voters. He delivered an easily understood vision of what the problems are and how to fix it. Furthermore, this vision coincides with how the voters see the problem.\n\nI didn't hear anything that would be that convincing regarding the economy from Hillary, just a lot of promises for things that I don't think the voters feel are connected to what they see as the problem. It's easy to blame Presidents for the actions of private businesses. Globalization was inevitable. There isn't a way to block businesses from doing business overseas. When deregulation cranked up in the 80s, and every large business went public and shifted their business models from innovation and QC in the U.S. to a growth focus, we set the stage for our problems now. Businesses had to show growth every year, and to do that they outsourced manufacturing and services overseas to places where wages were lower. They cut costs at the sacrifice of quality. And in going overseas, they shifted as much capital as possible into low tax shelters away from U.S. taxation reach.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump spoke about the 2.5 trillion untaxeable monies held overseas. Neither candidate has a real plan or really has any control over repatraiting that money. As a public business, there would have to be significant subsidy and incentives to bring that money back. Honestly, I think what we did in the 80s really screwed the pooch. I just wonder how in the SCS or in the hell we got to where we are. All tonight made me do is think back to the right and maybe at least 1 of them will care. There's an old adage that if you want to see who won a debate, watch it with the sound off. I recorded the debate so I might try that. Can \"Semi-Exactly\" become a meme?  If it doesn't, there's no justice in this world. I've flown to airports in developing countries, and I'll take Dulles and it's nice, clean, monorail over the cluster in Honduras any day of the week.\n\nAlso, I might be misremebering, but I'm almost positive I couldn't get a Cinnabon in Kigali. I'm glad that she crushed him and baited him so easily the whole debate. It's fucking scary how close this is and while I liked Holt's job overall I'm pretty fucking mad that immigration and the wall (the freaking main issue that got him here) wasn't brought up. WTH My favorite Trump quote of the night \"I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\"\n\nWat?! MSNBC: Trump is claiming he had a defective microphone  Nuclear war is the greatest threat to the world. Therefore, we should transactionalize its prevention. Can anyone independent, and rather undecided but will definitely vote, and not living along either US coast, give their honest opinion? [removed] Aren't there more important things to think about than who shook hands with whom? Thoughts on Kelly Anne and her ability to not answer questions as a Campaign Manager... People are saying Donald was on coke, which is clearly ridiculous, people on coke fucking love to talk about their specific plans for the future. As a right-winger, I have to say I was surprisingly impressed with Hillary Clinton's performance.\n\nShe managed to smile continuously for 90 minutes. I'm a huge Clinton supporter but I don't think Trump came off as badly as some of you seem to think. You have to keep in mind that many, if not most, voters are pretty stupid, and overall he didn't completely fuck up. For many people that is good enough, it's worrying enough as it is. \n\nI'm also going to go ahead and say this, but Clinton did come on pretty strong at certain points during the debate. Less so than Trump, but she is a woman. For slightly more deplorable people than most, they might take this badly and view her attitude as \"smug\" or dare I say \"uppity\". \n\nShe also smiled a lot, which is a female-only requirement because I did not see Trump crack a single half smile during that debate. It's a double edged sword for her, because again, some idiots think it's a sign of \"smugness\". All tonight made me do is think back to the contentious but civilized debates between Bush and Gore, Bush and Kerry, McCain and Obama, and especially Romney and Obama and wonder how in the hell we got to where we are  being unbiased \n\nwho won?  TL:DW : Mr. Trump, you need to expand specifically on that.\n              Mrs. Clinton, do you care to ramble on aimlessly for several minutes? Tune into CBS for a live late show and Colbert's debate take. Donald surely seemed very proud to have exploited his workers. One thing I haven't seen anyone bring up: Trump criticized the Iran deal as one of the worst deals ever because Iran was about to collapse due to our sanctions. About two minutes later he blamed Clinton and Obama for starting ISIS by pulling out of Iraq and creating instability. Does he not realize that letting Iran collapse would also create instability and a power vacuum that would facilitate a terrorist? This just shows the lack of political knowledge that would make him a disaster as president.\n\nOf course this doesn't fit in a soundbite so you probably won't hear anything about it. Hillary is showing off her stamina as she stops by a debate watch event moments after the debate ended. CNN Audience Poll: 62% Clinton, 27% Trump. just got out of the movies, what did I miss?  By the hype the media gave this I had low expectations that this was gonna be anti climatic but boy was I wrong. If nothing else Trump is an entertainer and didn't disappoint. How the undecided view this will be telling over the next few weeks.  I will never understand why people think that we should hand our country over to people who aren't politicians.  Would you want your surgery to be performed only by people who weren't doctors? even Hugh Hewitt admits that Trump bombed the birther answer  You know, claiming your projects came in under budget isn't a strong move when you were just accused of not paying anybody... Why the shit would a Bernie supporter go to Trump?  And campaign finance reform wasn't on the schedule for tonight. Stop giving millenials a bad name I would honestly try to listen to Trump if he just wasn't so rude and stuck-up. I don't think I've seen a man with less manners than him on a Presidential Debate stage. Stolen from another thread:\n\n&gt;I read somewhere today that trump expectations were so low that if he just showed up and didn't do dick jokes he'd win points. Looks like he should have done dick jokes. I think while Trump did badly tonight, he's going to 'get away' with it for the same reason he's gotten away with almost everything in this race - he said so many batshit and offensive things in this debate that none will be focused on. He defended his birtherism. He basically admitted he pays no taxes. He was called out for his sexism quite badly. He statements on his temperament were absurd. At the end he did a crazy thing and gave himself credit for *holding back* something he never stated.\n\nWhat will happen, of course, is that the discussion will be *about* the fact that he says horrible stuff. And not *about the horrible stuff itself*. No narrative will form around any particular controversy. And so it will all sort of fade away.\n\nHillary will continue to get hammered with the same 1-2 things; her honesty and her emails. And so narratives form around those things.\n\nI just don't see how this dynamic changed at all tonight. Sadly. I just wonder how many YouTube videos will be made suggesting that a Hillary clone was at debate? Probably hundreds. I really think this is the end of the GOP as we know it.\n\nMost of the highly prominent Republicans, Tea Party or just plain Conservative, backed this guy under the conviction of having a 'strong party'. Not only do I think Trump will lose the election, I think the GOP will lose *hard*, having many of their congressional positions taken over by democrats and losing the Supreme Court.\n\nThe GOP is going to have to undergo a serious makeover after this election, I don't think the Tea Party people or the Alt-Right will be welcome there anymore. The Conservatives who are backing Trump now will do as much as they can to distance themselves from both him and other extremists in the party.\n\nI know people were saying this during the Obama-Romney elections too, but this time I think the Republicans have gone too far and will have to pivot back towards the center. This time, instead of Democrats becoming more right-wing in stance, the Republicans will become more left-wing in stance.\n\nI could be wrong though, wouldn't be the first time. But the results of this debate are not promising for Trump. I can't believe the margin of victory I just witnessed. That was a historically bad performance for Donald Trump.  My favorite part was where Trump somehow turned his being 100% wrong, as expected, all along, about Obama's birth certificate into some kind of victory on the grounds that HE was the one who got him to release it.  That's what kids on the playground do.\n\nedit:  I can't recall at the present, but did whatever he was responding to have anything at all to do with said birth certificate?\n MSNBC: Trump says his regret of the night was not bringing up Bill's infidelity. Trump says he held back because Chelsea was in the room.\n Trump's campaign manager says Hillary was \"smug\" and that Trump held back  Jeffrey Lord: It's still possible Obama wasn't born in the U.S., remember Chester A. Arthur?\n\nIt's a totally normal narrative, guys. Guys...? Van Jones is laying the hurt on Jeffrey Lords Oh, it's not racist now to question our first black president's birthplace? Who are these ppl on CNN panel right now ? Is there a way to check ? So now he's claiming he's paid federal taxes? Chuck Todd: Trump took the bait every time every time she through it out there  Wow, Fake Tony Soprano looked pretty shell-shocked during that interview. Chris Christie on MSBNC: (paraphrased) I'm sure Donald made some factual errors, and I'm sure Hillary Clinton did too, but the difference is that when she has made mistakes she has been in office\n\nSo, I guess he's saying Trump will stop making mistakes if he's elected? Christie:\"We gonna rely on fact checkers?\" SOMEBODY CALL SEAN HANNITY Chris Christie: \"If Donald didn't show up to the next 2 debates Hillary still wouldn't win\" \n\nChristie has obviously left planet earth  I legitimately believe Trump is abusing drugs of some sort. Between his extremely anxious behavior and incessant sniffing at the beginning of the debate, it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest to hear he's taking uppers. I can't believe the wall was not mentioned once. Christie now saying that Hillary is nothing but \"sound bites\" on msnbc  CALL SEAN HANNITY!!!!!!!!! America is a third world county  I didn't talk about Bill Clinton's past because I respect Chelsea.\n\nMeh. Maybe I'll do it next time. Oh, he's a good person for not talking about Bill Clinton? What slime I feel so freaking scared right now about all of this. Donald Trump is probably going to be my next president.", "tv": "\"THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT.
